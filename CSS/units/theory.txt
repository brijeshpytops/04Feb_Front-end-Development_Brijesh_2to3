%, px, em, rem, vh, vw

In CSS, units define measurements for elements, such as width, height, padding, margin, font size, and more

1. Percentage (%)
Relative to the parent element's size.

div {
  width: 50%; /* 50% of the parent container's width */
}


2. Pixels (px)
Absolute unit (fixed size).
Commonly used for font sizes, widths, heights, margins, and padding.

p {
  font-size: 16px; /* Sets font size to 16 pixels */
}

3. em (Relative to Parent Font Size)
1em = size of the parent element’s font-size.
Useful for scalable typography.

body {
  font-size: 16px;
}
p {
  font-size: 2em; /* 2 * 16px = 32px */
}

4. rem (Relative to Root Font Size)
1rem = size of the root element’s (<html>) font-size.
Unlike em, rem does not depend on the parent element.

html {
  font-size: 16px;
}
p {
  font-size: 2rem; /* 2 * 16px = 32px */
}

5. Viewport Height (vh) & Viewport Width (vw)
vh is relative to the height of the viewport (browser window).
vw is relative to the width of the viewport.
1vh = 1% of the viewport height.
1vw = 1% of the viewport width.
Useful for full-screen layouts.

div {
  width: 100vw; /* Full viewport width */
  height: 50vh; /* Half of viewport height */
}


Unit	Best Used For
--------------------------------------------
%	    Flexible layouts, responsive designs
px	    Fixed-size elements (not scalable)
em	    Typography (relative to parent)
rem	    Typography (relative to root)
vh	    Full-screen layouts (height)
vw	    Full-screen layouts (width)

Absolute Units (Fixed sizes)
These do not depend on anything else and always remain the same.

px (pixels) – Common for screens.
cm (centimeters) – Mostly used for print styles.
mm (millimeters) – Also for print.
in (inches) – 1in = 2.54cm = 96px.
pt (points) – 1pt = 1/72 of an inch (used in typography).
pc (picas) – 1pc = 12pt (used in print).

Relative Units (Change based on context)
These depend on the font size, viewport, or other elements.

% (Percentage) – Relative to the parent element.
em – Relative to the font-size of the parent element.
rem – Relative to the root (<html>) font size.
vw (Viewport Width) – 1vw = 1% of the viewport width.
vh (Viewport Height) – 1vh = 1% of the viewport height.
vmin – 1% of the smaller dimension (width or height).
vmax – 1% of the larger dimension (width or height).
ex – Relative to the height of the letter "x" in the current font.
ch – Relative to the width of the "0" (zero) character in the font.
lh – Relative to the line-height of the element.
rlh – Relative to the root line-height.

Special Units
fr (Fractional Unit in CSS Grid)

Used in CSS Grid to divide space.
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; /* First column takes 1 part, second takes 2 */
}

auto – Adjusts size based on content or available space.

calc() – Allows calculations in CSS.
