CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It defines how HTML elements should be displayed, including their colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, and positioning.

Key Features of CSS:
Separation of Content and Design – Keeps HTML structure separate from styling.
Consistency – Enables uniform styling across multiple web pages.
Responsiveness – Helps create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
Efficiency – Reduces code duplication by using reusable styles.
Cascading Rules – Allows multiple stylesheets and rules to apply in an order of priority.
